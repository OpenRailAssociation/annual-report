"*2025 has seen the acceleration of the open source concept all over the world, particularly through the intensive and impressive evolution of A models but not only. It now becomes clearer and clearer that open source is a major vector of innovation and business, not contradicting the search by private companies for market leadership or financial outcomes, because the genuine capacity to sustain the pace of innovation is to replace more and more the traditional owned assets in intellectual domains. The mission of OpenRail is then obvious and exciting: to facilitate this disruptive transition also in the railway domain.*" -- Jean-Michel Evanghelou, *Vice-Chair*, Director Digital Systems & Innovation, Director Financial Control & Project Operations at **UIC**
