"*When introducing the open‑source philosophy to Infrabel’s Product Owners, I was struck by the genuine enthusiasm it generated. Everyone immediately recognised that we share the same challenges—and that building solutions together is the most natural path forward. Now let’s all free up some space in our busy agendas to put this strategy into action and truly get the ball rolling!*" -- Peter Franken, *Director*, Deputy CIO, Head of Real Time & End User Solutions at **Infrabel**
