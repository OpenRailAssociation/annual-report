"*Open source and open standards are fundamental to enabling seamless, cross-border rail services in Europe. Frameworks such as MMTIS and the new TSI Telematics clearly point in the same direction: interoperable, standardised, and easy-to-use data across operators and national borders. From Entur’s perspective, openness is a practical necessity – it lowers barriers for collaboration, reduces fragmentation, and allows shared digital services developed through the OpenRail Association to deliver real value for railway operators, developers, and the passengers.*" -- Brede Dammen, *Director*, Product owner, national journey planner at **Entur**
