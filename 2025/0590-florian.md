"*I am proud to look back on a year marked by significant progress. The technical committee has matured in terms of both governance and execution, formalizing clearer incubation stages — now Onboarded → Qualified → Adopted — to better guide projects and contributors. We celebrated key milestones, such as the close cooperation between SNCF Réseau and SBB on Netzgrafik-Editor and the integration of PopUpSim into the DAC migration DSS. Projects such as OSRD, NGE, RCM-OSS, and LibLRS flourished with new releases, new features, and improved documentation, while promising candidates progressed through the incubation process. Going forward, our improved processes will position us well to welcome more projects and foster collaborations. This is just the beginning.*" -- Florian Amsallem, *Chair Technical Committee*, OSRD Technical Lead at **SNCF Réseau**
