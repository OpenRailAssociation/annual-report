### First Project Reaching the Qualified Stage

On February 27, 2025, OSRD became the first OpenRail project to reach the **Qualified stage**, marking a significant milestone in the association's incubation process, achieved in just one year after being hosted by the OpenRailAssociation. The Qualified stage represents projects that have achieved a high level of quality and maturity, ready for production use by end users.

To reach this stage, the OSRD team undertook substantial work to meet eight rigorous criteria covering governance, security, and development practices. Key achievements included documenting the release process, establishing a comprehensive security policy, and conducting an OpenSSF Scorecard benchmark that scored 6.1/10. The project implemented **REUSE compliance** with automated CI checks to ensure licensing clarity, and enforced the **Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)** to guarantee code provenance. Perhaps the most significant requirement was demonstrating a healthy and stable contributor base, which OSRD achieved through consistent contributions from SNCF Réseau and active production deployment.

This qualification signifies that OSRD has established robust processes for external contributions, transparent governance, and industry-standard security practices. The improved documentation and clear pathways for participation make OSRD more accessible to contributors and adopters throughout the railway industry, positioning it as a mature, production-ready solution for railway operations and capacity planning.
