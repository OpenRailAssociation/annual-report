The railway industry can’t ignore geopolitics. In a rapidly evolving geopolitical environment, digital resilience — grounded in sovereignty and security — has become a strategic necessity for critical infrastructure. Across the rail sector, Open Source is increasingly recognized as a cornerstone of resilient digital systems. This reinforces the strategic relevance of the OpenRail Association and its mission to advance the collaborative development of Open Source Software for rail.

#### From Foundation to Delivery

During 2025, we further strengthened our organization by improving governance, increasing efficiency, and sharpening our ability to support members and projects. This consolidation has positioned us to scale collaboration more effectively.

#### Creating Real Value

OpenRail projects create value by translating collaboration into solutions that are built and used in real-world operations. The Netzgrafik-Editor / Open Source Railway Designer collaboration between SBB and SNCF is one example that demonstrates this approach. Together, OpenRail projects show how open source practices generate tangible business outcomes.

#### A Community Gaining Momentum

The growing maturity of our community was clearly visible at OpenRail Day @Paris. The professionalism, openness, and engagement on display reflected an ecosystem aligned around collaboration as a driver of digital transformation in rail.

#### Looking Ahead

2025 marked the shift from foundation-building to measurable impact. As we enter 2026, momentum is growing and collaborative software development is proving its ability to build practical solutions for rail.

**Yours sincerely,**

**Jochen Decker**
