"*In an industry that inherently depends on collaboration across borders and organizations, open source has proven to be a vital enabler of innovation with real-world impact — but to truly transform the railway sector, it must be accessible not only to developers but also to the domain experts who understand the real-world challenges. At the Flatland Association, this is at the heart of what we do: building an open ecosystem that empowers anyone to contribute, lowering the entry barrier so that open research and open source can reach the people who need it most. Together with the OpenRail Association, we are making this ecosystem stronger, and events like OpenRail Day in Paris show that this community is growing every year.*" -- Erik Nygren, *Director*, President at **Flatland Association**
