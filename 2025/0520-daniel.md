"*The year 2025 was marked by significant progress and increasing engagement within the Open Rail Association. Open Rail Day in Paris was a highlight that demonstrated both the speed of development and the effective collaboration within the community. In 2026, open source will become an even more important part of IT strategies, particularly in light of economic pressures and geopolitical tensions.*"
