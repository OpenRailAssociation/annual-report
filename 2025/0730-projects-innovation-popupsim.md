### Innovation through Open Source (DAC Migration DSS)
<p>
Innovation doesn’t always start in boardrooms. There is also grassroots development in the railway sector, such as PopUpSim. PopUpSim is an independent part of the DAC Migration DSS with its own repository. It joined the OpenRailAssociation in 2025.

The idea for PopUpSim emerged during the Dreiländerhack (now: Hack4Rail), which took place from 30 September to 1 October 2024 in Berlin. A team of developers from DB, SBB and ÖBB tackled a challenge concerning the simulation of wagon flows from operations to workshops and back to operations during the migration from the screw coupler to the Digital Automatic Coupler. The team created a demonstrator and won third prize at the hackathon.

After some time, which was necessary to create an environment for further development, a new team started working on the project. On 17 December 2025, it was already possible to present a veritable Minimum Viable Product to the public at OpenRailDay in Paris.

The team is now working ambitiously to fully realize the idea of PopUpSim, secure funding for further development, and promote its use.
Another aspect is worth noting: as mentioned above, PopUpSim supports the rollout of the Digital Automatic Coupler. The introduction of the Digital Automatic Coupler is not just a challenge faced by every actor in the rail freight sector; it is a challenge that must be solved collectively by the entire sector. There are more than 500,000 freight wagons across Europe. A typical freight wagon does not operate in only one country; it usually runs cross-border and is hauled by traction from many different railway undertakings. In many cases, wagons are owned by leasing companies rather than by the railway undertakings themselves. To make matters even more challenging, not only mainline railways must be able to handle wagons; port railways and industrial sidings must also be able to receive and move wagons at all times during the migration period. This shared challenge clearly calls for an open-source solution. It can be used by everyone free of charge, its code is transparent, and users can adapt it to their needs and share it with their customers and partners.
