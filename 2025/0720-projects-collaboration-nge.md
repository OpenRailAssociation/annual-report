#### Netzgrafik‑Editor – ```Designed for better decisions```

If you want to go fast, go alone.
If you want to go far, go together.

##### Open Source as a Shared Path
Across many areas of the railway industry, the same pattern emerges: challenges are complex, markets are small, and specialized tools often develop in isolation. Companies build similar solutions in parallel, unaware of each other’s work and unable to benefit from it. The result is a patchwork of isolated systems — each with its own concepts, interfaces, and technical foundations. Knowledge gets lost, synergies remain unused, and innovation progresses more slowly than it should. Out of this situation grew the desire for a different approach: one based not on isolation, but on collaboration.

The Netzgrafik‑Editor demonstrates how powerful this approach can be. Instead of building yet another proprietary tool, the project deliberately chose the Open Source path. In its early stages, the goal was to validate the core idea of the Netzgrafik‑Editor. The journey began as an internal, proprietary prototype that quickly revealed a clear need: a solution that enables fast creation, analysis, and testing of strategic long‑term timetable and service planning scenarios. This filled a significant gap in the planning process and marked the start of the Netzgrafik‑Editor as a classic innovation project within SBB.

With the proof‑of‑value, it soon became clear that the tool could benefit not only SBB but the entire industry. In parallel with the emerging Open Source initiative around the OpenRail Association, the desire grew to open the tool, publish it, and build a living, collaborative project together with industry partners. This marked the beginning of a targeted search for partners — because at the very start, no community existed, and no one outside knew that a new tool was being created.

Through active community building, we were quickly able to attract early adopters and development partners. It was hard work, but the results are impressive – today we are proud of our broad community of software developers, planners, designers, students, and enthusiasts. Such a broad community is a very important prerequisite for the successful development of open innovation and open source.

In addition to building a developer community, we decided to place a strong focus on users. From the very beginning of the open-source initiative, we committed not only to publishing the source code but also to providing a fully functional, publicly accessible application [^1]. This was crucial in generating interest among the user community. These users are driving the initiative forward significantly – they work intensively to integrate the tool into their daily workflows, give us direct and unfiltered feedback, and broaden our horizons with feature requests based on real-world business needs. This user perspective is extremely valuable for the continuous improvement of the project.

##### An Emerging Ecosystem
The openness of the tool allows third parties to build upon it. An ecosystem of expert tools is emerging, using the Netzgrafik‑Editor as a data foundation and extending the analysis with their own specialized solutions. A prime example is the integration with OSRD. Through close cooperation, new perspectives become possible, and the Netzgrafik‑Editor fills an important gap within OSRD.

This synergy shows how valuable it is to combine different requirements and capabilities through mutual complementing. At the same time, openness fundamentally changes the dynamics of development: it creates a foundation for new ideas and enables diverse perspectives. Not only does SBB contribute established concepts, but SNCF does as well — broadening the shared knowledge base and benefiting both companies and the entire industry.

The roadmap is no longer defined behind closed doors but collaboratively — visible and discussable for everyone. Every voice in the industry can contribute and help shape the new standards that such a tool is capable of creating.

##### Conclusion
What stands out most is how motivation and speed have changed. While traditional projects often struggle with budgets, priorities, or organizational boundaries, the Netzgrafik‑Editor has shifted cultural boundaries through the intrinsic motivation of many contributors. What initially met resistance — releasing a tool for free — has now become widely supported. Today, no one questions whether it was the right decision; instead, people actively advocate for keeping it that way.

The benefits of synergy are increasingly recognized, and the number of people willing to contribute continues to grow. This has created an innovative force far beyond what any single company could achieve. New features emerge faster, problems are solved collaboratively, and knowledge spreads naturally through the open structure — improving the quality of the product itself.

At the same time, it becomes clear that Open Source is more than a license model. It is a culture. A culture that demands transparency and offers trust. A culture that sees diversity not as a disturbance but as a driver of better solutions. And a culture that creates standards because they are carried by many — not dictated by a few. The Netzgrafik‑Editor has become a shared reference point: a tool that is not only used, but understood, improved, and co‑created.

This form of collaboration is transforming the industry. It builds shared understanding across countries and companies. It reduces duplication of effort and strengthens innovation. And it shows that the railway industry — often perceived as slow‑moving — is fully capable of embracing modern, open, and collaborative ways of working. The Netzgrafik‑Editor is not just a tool; it is an example of how Open Source can become a strategic advantage for companies, developers, and the entire sector.

In the end, one simple insight remains: when many people work together toward a shared goal, they create something greater than the sum of its parts. As the African proverb says: If you want to go fast, go alone. If you want to go far, go together.  
This is the path the Netzgrafik‑Editor community has chosen — and it shows how far you can go when you walk it together.
