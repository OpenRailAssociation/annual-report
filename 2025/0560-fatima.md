"*OpenRail is The platform to design and build strong standardized and interoperable Railway solutions, reinforce the collaboration around that in the Railway community, and take all advantages offered by Open Source to achieve that. At ONCF, and because Railway sector is still facing challenges of complex in house development, we believe that this community is here to bring answers to the daily complexities that the sector is facing and empowering the digitalization of future mobility following open standards and giving the capabilities for acceleration and interoperability. These initiatives are also necessary to reduce the technical debt, and respect best standard for cybersecurity and sovereignty. The outcome exhibited during the OpenRail day in Paris confirmes that we are in the right track and makes us proud and also excited of all the success to come. *" -- Fatima Zohra El Ouerkhaoui, *Director*, Chief Information and Digital Officer, Board member at **ONCF**
