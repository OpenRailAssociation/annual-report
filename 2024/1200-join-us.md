## Join us

The **OpenRail Association** is more than just an organization—it’s a **community of people and companies** working together to bring **open source to the railway sector**.

Railways across Europe face **shared challenges** that require **shared solutions**. Open source enables us to **collaborate, innovate, and break down silos**, ensuring that essential software is **interoperable, efficient, and sustainable**.

### Bring Your Project to OpenRail

OpenRail actively **welcomes new projects** into its **incubation process**. If you have a project that could benefit from **structured governance, a wider community, and long-term sustainability**, our **Technical Committee** provides guidance, best practices, and a neutral home for open-source railway software.
