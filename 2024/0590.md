## Executive Summary

The **OpenRail Association** was founded in 2024 to **bring open source to the railway sector**, fostering collaboration and innovation across railway operators, infrastructure managers, and developers. This **first annual report** highlights the **milestones of our founding year**, the **progress of our open source projects**, and the **momentum we are building for the future**.

### A Year of Progress

Since its launch in **January 2024**, OpenRail has established itself as a **neutral, trusted space** for railway stakeholders to collaborate on open software solutions.  In its first year, it grew its community, launched five projects through a structured incubation process, and actively connected the ecosystem through key industry events.

### OpenRail Projects

In 2024, OpenRail **onboarded five open source projects** that are shaping the future of railway software:

* **OSRD** – Open Source Railway Designer for **infrastructure simulation, timetabling, and short-term capacity planning**.
* **RCM OSS** – Rail Condition Monitoring software based on **the open RCM-DX data format**.
* **DAC Migration DSS** – Decision Support System for **managing the migration to Digital Automatic Coupling** in freight rail.
* **Netzgrafik-Editor (NGE)** – A **graphical editor** for designing and analyzing **regular-interval timetables**.
* **libLRS** – A **library for linear reference systems**, helping locate railway infrastructure elements along tracks.

### Building the Organization

The **OpenRail Association was formally incorporated as an international non-profit (AISBL) under Belgian law** in 2024. With an expanding **Board of Directors** and the establishment of the **Technical Committee**, we have built a solid foundation to support **governance, incubation, and collaboration**.

### Looking Ahead

In 2025, we aim to **scale our projects**, attract **new initiatives**, and strengthen **collaboration between projects**. Our focus will be on **deepening collaboration between members and projects**, ensuring that open source solutions gain **broader adoption and long-term sustainability** in the railway sector.

### Join Us

We invite **railway operators, infrastructure managers, and innovators** to **explore the benefits of open source**. OpenRail provides a **framework for sustainable collaboration**, and we welcome new **members, contributors, and projects** into our ecosystem.
