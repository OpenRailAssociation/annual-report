## OpenRail Projects

*One-page overview of the projects with brief summary and ideally some icon to visually represent each project.*

*For each project we will add the incubation stage as a small visiual indicator using the [badge](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/42).*

*In the following subsections we have a deep dive for each project (`07xx.md`).*

*Each project should address the following topics:*

* *Which domain, which business requirement does it address*
* *Which functionality*
* *Technology*
* *Adoption, community*
* *Potential, future perspective*
* *Reached milestones*
