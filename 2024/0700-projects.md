## OpenRail Projects

*One-page overview of the projects with brief summary and ideally some icon to visually represent each project.*

*For each project we will add the incubation stage as a small visiual indicator using the [badge](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/issues/42).*

*In the following subsections we have a deep dive for each project (`07xx.md`).*

*Each project should address the following topics:*

* *Which domain, which business requirement does it address*
* *Which functionality*
* *Technology*
* *Adoption, community*
* *Potential, future perspective*
* *Reached milestones*


In 2024 the OpenRail Association accepted the first five open source projects in its [incubation process](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/technical-committee/blob/main/incubation-process.md). Dive deeper on each of the projects on the following pages.

### Open Source Railway Designer (OSRD)

Within the next years around 500 K freight wagons all over Europe owned and operated by various corporations will be converted from screw couplers to digital automatic couplers (DAC). To facilitate the migration process, a decision support system (DSS) is planned under the project.

### Netzgrafik-Editor (NGE)

Netzgrafik-Editor is now a mature tool for creating and analyzing regular-interval timetables. It's versatile for logistics planning in various domains. Features include interactive editing, graphic timetables, trainrun editing, and logistics analysis.

### Library for Linear Reference Systems (libLRS)

![](https://openrailassociation.org/badges/openrail-project-stage-1.svg)

The goal of the library is to have a flexible, high performance and easy to integrate linear referencing systems (LRS) library that can be used in any system to manipulate LRSs.
