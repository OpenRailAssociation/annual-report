"The open source model has demonstrated to be an accelerator for progress and innovation in several industries, with a true collaborative approach increasing both the relevance and the adoption of software solutions. It is essential that the railway market, with its digital transformation and its strong contribution to the multimodal and sustainable transport of tomorrow, builds on this promising domain. OpenRail has been set with this objective." -- Jean-Michel Evanghelou, *Vice-Chair*, Director Telecom, Signalling & Digital Applications, Director Financial Controlling & Project Operations at **UIC**
