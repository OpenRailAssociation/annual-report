## Open Source for the Railway Sector

The **OpenRail Association** exists to bridge the world of railways and open source—two domains that can achieve far more together than apart. We believe that the **power of open collaboration** is key to tackling the challenges the railway sector faces in its digital transformation.

In many industries, open source has already proven to increase **efficiency, accelerate innovation, and foster interoperability**. We want to make these benefits accessible to the railway sector by helping projects and organizations apply **open source principles in ways that fit the railway context**. This means aligning culture, processes, and governance with the needs of railway professionals and their stakeholders. That’s where OpenRail creates real value.

**Shared, open foundations do not mean losing control—they mean gaining flexibility, reducing costs, and moving faster than any single organization could on its own.**

To get there, it takes a bit of courage — to work in the open, to invite others in, and to share decision-making. That’s what **open governance** is about: boosting collaboration to the next level by creating transparency, inclusiveness, and trust. OpenRail provides a **well-defined and safe space** for organizations to take that leap.

Our focus is on the **practical work happening in the projects**. Each project operates in an **autonomous, hands-on way**, while being connected through the shared framework and values of the OpenRail Association. This structure enables focus, reduces friction, and removes barriers that often slow down progress in traditional environments. It allows contributors to get things done — together, efficiently, and with lasting impact.

We are building an **open house for the railway sector**, where expertise is shared, technology evolves collectively, and companies can build upon reliable, transparent, and reusable solutions. As a neutral association, we provide the structure and space needed to **connect stakeholders, incubate projects, and enable long-term collaboration**.

In 2025, we are focused on **supporting the growth of our existing projects**, helping them mature in quality, governance, and adoption. At the same time, we are actively looking to **welcome new projects and members** that address real-world railway challenges. Our goal is to ensure that open source in railways is not a collection of isolated efforts, but a **vibrant, connected ecosystem** that benefits everyone involved.
