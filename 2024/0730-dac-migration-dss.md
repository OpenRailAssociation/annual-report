### Digital Automatic Coupling Migration Decision Support System {.project}

**The Digital Automatic Coupling (DAC) will be the major move towards competitive and digital rail traffic. There is widespread consensus that the roll-out of the DAC should be supported. But how to migrate about 500,000 freight wagons as well as locomotives and maintenance vehicles from the current screw-coupler to the modern DAC? This is where the DAC Migration DSS comes into play. DSS stands for Decision Support System.**

The goal is to develop a decision support system for planning stages of DAC Migration. Three stages have been identified:

* **Strategic Planning:** In this phase a pan-European rough-cut plan for migration is set up. At this point in time data available is not detailed and not reliable. There is a high degree of freedom and many properties of the migration process can still be formed. Therefore, many scenarios have to be computed. Only few people which are especially trained are working with the DSS, therefore the user interface can be low-level.
* **Detailed Planning:** In this phase rail undertakings and wagon keepers as well as other organizations have to conduct the planning. The plans on corporate level are detailed and accurate data is available. The corporate plans have to be put together on European level by an organization in charge e.g. the DAC Deployment Manager. Thus, the DSS has to provide a comfortable user-interface and support coordination and collaboration. In this phase corporations also apply for grants and funding for the DAC retrofit, therefore a direct interface from the DAC Migration DSS to the funding entities has to be set up.
* **Monitoring:** Once the migration has started, progress has to be monitored on corporate as well as on centralized level. Interfaces to legacy maintenance systems have to be set up and data has to be visualized for decision makers. If deviations from the original plan occur, alternative scenarios must be quickly set up.

In 2024 several milestones advanced the development of DAC Migration DSS. A **whitepaper** was published, outlining the system’s functional and non-functional requirements. A **mathematical model** was formulated to define the [linear model](https://github.com/OpenRailAssociation/dac-migration-dss/blob/main/doc/DAK_Migration_DSS_Model_V2.0.pdf) for migration planning. The system was also part of the **"Drei-Länderhack" hackathon**, where a team worked on DAC migration challenges. A notable result was [PopupSim](https://openrail-playground.github.io/PopupSim/), a prototype simulation tool for DAC Migration, which won third place. In parallel, the **DACFIT project**, funded by Europe's Rail under Call HORIZON-JU-ER-2023-01 (Project 101178150), was launched to support the initial implementation. The first minimum viable implementation of the DSS is expected in October 2025, with the first migration plan generated by October 2026.

Although the first step is funded by DACFIT, further implementation of the DAC Migration DSS requires additional funding. The signs for funding the overall DAC Migration are promising. It will be
important to promote the DAC Migration DSS as a fundamental part of the roll-out.
