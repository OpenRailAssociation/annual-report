### Open Source Railway Designer {.project}

## 1. Domain and Business Requirement

### Operational studies

Operation studies assess the ability of infrastructures to meet demand, and balance infrastructure capacity with transportation needs. They enable informed public infrastructure investment decisions. They therefore need a tool that can simulate and visualize trains capacity on a prospective infrastructure.

### Short term capacity management

Even though most train paths are allocated years before operations, a growing part is allocated shortly before the planned departure time. This change is largely due to growing demand for rail freight.
It is therefore necessary for a railway company to get answers to its freight train path requests quickly, and this cannot be achieved without a tool that automates this process.

## 2. Functionality

**Core Features:**
- Running time calculation
- Signaling and conflict simulation
- Infrastructure edition
- Rolling stock edition

**Key Strengths:**
- Simulation speed: STDCM can be found in less than 1 minute and large timetable (more than 15000 trains) can be loaded in a single scenario.
- Design and simplicity: Our interface is simple and visually pleasing, which enhances our users' results.

## 3. Technology

OSRD is a web application. We use modern, industrialized technologies.

**Technology Stack:**
- Core (backend): Kotlin & Java
- Editoast (backend): Rust (axum)
- Osrdyne (scaling component): Rust (axum)
- Gateway: Rust (actix)
- Message broker: RabbitMQ
- Databases: Postgresql & Valkey
- Frontend: React

**Architecture:**

// TODO: Include architecture schema.

## 4. Adoption and Community

OSRD is deployed at SNCF réseau and used for our two use cases.

**User Adoption:**
- Used by 4 Railway Companies
- Used by ~25 railway study operators at SNCF Réseau

**Community Engagement:**
- We work closely with NetzgraphikEditor. Which has been integrated into the application.
- We handle the small number of external contributions.
- We ensure that our frontend components can be imported in other projects. Some projects are starting to use them.

## 5. Potential and Future Perspective

**Usage:**
- We should have 40 companies using OSRD for STDCM by the end of march 2025
- More railway study operators at SNCF Réseau users should use OSRD
- We are in contact with several infrastructure managers other than SNCF Réseau who are interested in OSRD.

**Future Enhancements:**
- Ensure that our timetables can handle paced trains.
- Add signaling systems such as ETCS
- Make STDCM find more solutions by managing overtake.

## 6. Reached Milestones

In 2024, we achieved several major objectives:
- Revamp our user interface with brand new components.
- Easy import and export of timetable.
- Major stabilization of our functionalities to be able to open the application to our first users.

## Conclusion

OSRD project has made significant progress in 2024. With a revamped user interface, enhanced timetable management, and stabilized functionalities, OSRD has been successfully adopted by our first users at SNCF Réseau and a few railway companies.

Looking ahead, we aim to expand our user base to 40 companies by March 2025 and continue enhancing features like paced train handling and additional signaling systems. OSRD's open-source nature fosters collaboration and innovation, positioning it as a key tool for optimizing railway operations and infrastructure management.
